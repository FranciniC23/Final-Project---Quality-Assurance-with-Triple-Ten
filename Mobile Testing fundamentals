📱 Project 1: Manual Testing – Urban Routes App
In this project, I manually tested the Urban Routes mobile web app, which calculates routes, travel time, and costs based on various transportation modes (walking, car, taxi, scooter, etc.).

🔍 Key Responsibilities:
Reviewed and executed predefined test cases for core app functionality (e.g., route creation, transport selection).

Identified and documented bugs by comparing expected vs. actual results.

Reported issues in JIRA using detailed bug reports (including steps to reproduce, system info, and expected/actual results).

Tested across different modes like Optimal, Fastest, and Custom route calculations.

📄 Included in this folder:
test-cases.md: Executed manual test cases

bug-reports.md: Sample JIRA-style bug reports

⚙️ Tools used :

Urban Routes App (Test Environment) – The web app under test

JIRA – For bug tracking and detailed issue reporting

Test Case Document (Spreadsheet or Markdown) – To execute and track test cases
