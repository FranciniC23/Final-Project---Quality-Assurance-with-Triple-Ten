📱 Urban Scooter Mobile App – QA Task 2

📋 Overview
This repository documents my QA work testing the Urban Scooter mobile application. The focus was on validating key app features, ensuring layout and design accuracy, and identifying bugs. Results were recorded in Google Sheets, and all issues were reported in JIRA.

🛠️ What I Did
🔹 Prepared the environment using Android Studio and the mobile emulator, installed the APK, and configured the app to connect with the backend API
🔹 Designed test cases for highlighted features, including layout and design validations - Figma Layout - https://www.figma.com/design/Ql81P6XKXadabhs5Hi6BxP/mobile?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=zFbUjAwYpNAAXZMr-0
