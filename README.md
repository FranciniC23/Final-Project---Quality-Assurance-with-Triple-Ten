🚲 Urban Scooter Web Application – QA Task 1

This repository showcases my first QA project for the Urban Scooter web application. The focus was testing the web interface and validating the "About Customer" form on the "Place Order" screen to ensure functionality and identify bugs.

🔹 Studied app requirements and page layouts, including Figma designs - https://practicum-content.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/qa-us/pdf/Urban_Scooter_Requirements_Web_v1.2.pdf
🔹 Designed positive and negative test cases for the "About Customer" form (customer name and phone number)
